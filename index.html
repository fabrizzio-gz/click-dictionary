      <h2 style="text-align: center">The Odyssey</h2>
      <p style="text-align: center; line-height: 200%">
        Tell me, Muse, of the man of many ways, who was driven<br />
        far journeys, after he had sacked Troy’s sacred citadel.<br />
        Many were they whose cities he saw, whose minds he learned of,<br />
        many the pains he suffered in his spirit on the wide sea,<br />
        struggling for his own life and the homecoming of his companions.<br />
        Even so he could not save his companions, hard though<br />
        he strove to; they were destroyed by their own wild recklessness,<br />
        fools, who devoured the oxen of Helios, the Sun God,<br />
        and he took away the day of their homecoming. From some point<br />
        here, goddess, daughter of Zeus, speak, and begin our story.
      </p>
      <p style="text-align: center; line-height: 200%">
        Then all the others, as many as fled sheer destruction,<br />
        were at home now, having escaped the sea and the fighting.<br />
        This one alone, longing for his wife and his homecoming,<br />
        was detained by the queenly nymph Kalypso, bright among goddesses,<br />
        in her hallowed caverns, desiring that he should be her husband.<br />
        But when the circling of the years that very year came<br />
        in which the gods had spun for him his time of homecoming<br />
        to Ithaka, not even then was he free of his trial<br />
        nor among his won people. But all the gods pitied him<br />
        except Poseidon; he remained relentlessly angry<br />
        with godlike Odysseus, until he returned to his own country.
